- The [generic functional specification][spec] for Nexmo client libraries.
- [Related examples][examples] as guides to implementing the specification.

--------
- Client Libraries repositories should be named in this format: `nexmo-[language/runtime]`
  For example: `nexmo-java`, `nexmo-php`, `nexmo-node`
- Development should use feature branches merged into a `develop` branch.
- Releases should be tagged with semantic versions from the `master` branch.
